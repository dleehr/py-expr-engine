# py-expr-engine
Python Expression Engine for CWL

# Summary

The [engine.py](engine.py) script implements an [ExpressionEngineRequirement](http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-2/#expressionenginerequirement) for CWL. It is modeled after the [node-expr-engine](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/tree/master/reference/node-expr-engine), and the root object for scripting is `self`.
